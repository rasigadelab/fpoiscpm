# Fuzzy Poisson change point model

## Overview

Statistical process control of unobservable event rate. Uses
a fuzzy/probabilistic definition of uncertain events coded as event
probabilities in [0,1]. Defines a test statistic and null distribution
for the comparison of the rates of occurrence of the events across
time periods. Defines a permutation test to determine the significance
of the most significant deviation (MSD) in the context of a change point
model.
