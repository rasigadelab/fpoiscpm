Description: Statistical process control of unobservable event rate. Uses
    a fuzzy/probabilistic definition of uncertain events coded as event
    probabilities in [0,1]. Defines a test statistic and null distribution
    for the comparison of the rates of occurrence of the events across
    time periods. Defines a permutation test to determine the significance
    of the most significant deviation (MSD) in the context of a change point
    model.
